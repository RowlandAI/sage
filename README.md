Stop searching. Start asking.
Sage uses AI to highlight answers in your PDFs instantly.

## Why "Sage"?

At Rowland, we navigate complex land and energy documents‚Äîthat's where Sage came from. The problem, however, is universal: everyone wastes time searching through PDFs.

We named it Sage after the sagebrush that marks trails across the American West. Like sagebrush guides travelers through vast landscapes, Sage guides you through dense documents‚Äîwhether that's legal contracts, research papers, medical records, or financial reports.

Ask a question. Get highlights. That simple.
